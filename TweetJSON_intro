### Twitter JSON Objects 101 <a id="twitterJsonIntro" class="tall">&nbsp;</a>

Tweets are made up of a Tweet message, a posted time, a set of User (also referenced to as Author or Actor) attributes, a collection of engagement metadata, and sometimes geographical metadata. Twitter APIs provide Tweet metadata encoded in JSON, a simple data-exchange text format based on key/value pairs. Tweet JSON is made up various objects, objects that can have many attributes. For example, the following JSON represents select attributes of a Tweet object. The Tweet object is made up of other objects such as ```user```, ```entities``` and ```place``` .
