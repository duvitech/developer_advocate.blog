###Tweeting During a Flood

Back in August 2013 we posted two “tweeting in the rain” (Part 1 & Part 2) articles that explored potential roles social-media data could play in flood early-warning systems. These posts focused on investigating the use of twitter during seven significant rain events. Around noon on Wednesday, September 11, 2013 we posted Part 3, which discussed the opportunities and challenges social networks provide to the early warning community.  
 
It turned out that even early in its history, the Twitter network had become an important broadcast channel during natural disasters. 

As that day unfolded the rainfall steadily intensified enough that it was becoming more clear that this weather event was getting dangerous. ByXX:XX there was already X inches of rainfall, and [THESE warning came out].

That night  I stayed up late watching the flood and its aftermath unfold on Twitter, 140 characters at a time. As the photos and videos came in from across the region, it became more and more obvious that this event would have lasting ramifications.

Having just focused on how Twitter could play a critical role as a public broadcast system, a real-time network well positioned to communicate with a mobile audience, it was reassuring to see Twitter and other internet-based network help the region deal with the incredibly dangerous storm.

The Boulder County region was getting hammered with rain,  Early concerns about foothill creeks and canyons.
