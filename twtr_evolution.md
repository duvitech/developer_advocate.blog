# Introduction

Billions of Tweets have been posted since 2006. These Tweets encapsulate an amazing amount of human communications. This archive is an amazing research dataset that has supported an amazing number of use-cases. [Set-up the reason the following details are useful]

Gnip offers two sets of APIs that provide access to every publicly available Tweet. These products able users to build queries using a set of [PowerTrack Operators](http://support.gnip.com/apis/search_full_archive_api/rules.html#Operators). 

In 2012, Historical PowerTrack (HPT) was introduced and quickly because a widely utilized Twitter research tool. HPT enables users to associate a time period of interest and a set of 1,000 PowerTrack rules/filters to an historical ```Job```. HPT offers the same Operators as real-time PowerTrack and is built to deliver Tweets at scale. In fact, this product is used to generate and share the entire public archive of Tweets to the Library of Congress (LOC). HPT generates a time-series of 10-minute data files for download. These Jobs can result in thousands of large files that take many hours to both generate and download. The HPT API provides a variety of methods to create and monitor a Job's process. Essentially the API is used to manage a Job's lifecycle. 

In 201#, the 30-Day Search API was released.
